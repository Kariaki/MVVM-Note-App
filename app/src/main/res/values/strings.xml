    <string name="story">the work in that transaction is completed or nothing is done. The atomic property implies that partial changes made by a transaction must be undone if the transaction abort. Example: an ATM account cannot be debited if not credited.
Consistent
Data is in a state of consistency when a transaction starts and when it end successfully. That is constraints are true before the transaction starts, and the constraint will be true after the transaction terminates.
Example: if a user account is balanced before transaction, then the account should be balanced after transaction
Isolation:
As transactions run concurrently, transactions do not interfere with each other. In other words, a transaction should not overwrite change made by another transaction</string>
